# Evaluation metrics used for training and testing the Neural Nets

1. Train reconstruction accuracy.  

We pass back the train input string to the the network and check whether the network is able to reconstruct.
Train reconstruction accuracy is percentage of words the decrypter is able to decrypt given the encrypted input.

2. Test reconstruction accuracy.

We create a new random string and pass that to the encrypter network.
Using the encrypted network we get the encrypted representation of the words.
